Satchmobile
===============================

Satchmo [1] is a free, open source, online store built on Django[2].  Satchmobile [3] is a native mobile application that interfaces with RESTful web services[4] running on top of your Satchmo e-commerce site.  Satchmobile provides your customers with a native mobile interface to browse your Satchmo online catalog.  

How this Demo Works
===============================

This project was created to demonstrate how to render your Satchmo catalog natively using the RESTful Satchombile web service library.  The mobile apps were written in Mono for Android (M4A)[5] and MonoTouch[6] using C#.
